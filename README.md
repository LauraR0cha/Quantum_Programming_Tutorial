# Hello Quantum

Do you want to program quantum computers, but don't know where to start? Then you have found the right place! Here you will find a gamified tutorial to quantum programming, which will guide you in the creation of your first quantum programs.

The command line version found here will help you get started with QISKit. A version focussed on IBM's Quantum Experience will be released as an app soon.

This tutorial is currently in beta, and so content will be added over time. **We are seeking any and all feedback throughout this process to help us build the finished product. You can use the survey [here](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4213712/helloquantum-cl)**

## Current modes of play

You can start off with the **Main Tutorial**, which will introduce you to the basics of manipulating quantum information. The basic operations of quantum computing are introduced through a set of puzzles. The **Qubit Swapper** mode is more of the same.

After this, you may want the freedom to play around with the qubits used in the puzzles, and try out the skills you've learned. For this you can use the **Sandbox Mode**.

There are then a range of modes designed to interact with Jupyter notebooks that we've created. The tutorial will guide you to create your own program to solve a real problem, and the notebooks will allow you to run these programs on a real quantum computer.

Current supported modes are as follows.

* **Image Superposer**: Create quantum superpositions of images with the notebook [here](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/tree/master/image-superposer).

More are coming soon.

## How to Play

The game runs on the command line. To run it, start by downloading this repository using [this link](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/archive/master.zip) and unzipping it.

Once you've downloaded the repository, navigate with the terminal to

``` Quantum_Programming_Tutorial-master/Hello-Quantum```

Then use the following command to run the tutorial

```
python main.py
```

The program runs on the terminal. For best results, you should maximize the size of your command line window. If you need to change font and background settings, you can use the `âŒ˜,` shortcut on Mac. The *Basic* profile with Menlo 11pt font and white background work well.

## What next?

For some discussion of what is being done in the tutorial, check out the following articles.
* [Visualizing bits and qubits](https://medium.com/qiskitters/visualizing-bits-and-qubits-9af287047b28)

More are coming soon.

Once you have mastered this gamified tutorial, you will be writing the kind of quantum programs found in the [tutorial for the QISKit SDK](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial). So head there to find more inspiration.
