# Hello Quantum

Do you want to program quantum computers, but don't know where to start? Then you have found the right place! Here you will find a gamified tutorial to quantum programming. This will guide you in the creation of your first quantum programs using [QISKit](https://qiskit.org).

Content is still being added to this tutorial over time. Feel free to contribute! You can also provide feedback by using the survey [here](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4213712/helloquantum-cl).

## Current modes of play

Start off with the **Main Tutorial**, which will introduce you to the basics of manipulating quantum information. The basic operations of quantum computing are introduced through a set of puzzles. The **Qubit Swapper** mode is more of the same.

After this, you may want the freedom to play around with the qubits used in the puzzles, and try out the skills you've learned. For this you can use the **Sandbox Mode**.

There are then the following range of modes designed to interact with Jupyter notebooks that we've created. The tutorial will guide you to create your own program to solve a real problem, and the notebooks will allow you to run these programs on a real quantum computer.

* **Image Superposer**: Create quantum superpositions of images with the notebook [here](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/tree/master/image-superposer).

More are coming soon.

## How to Play

The easiest way to play is in your browswer. Simply click [this link](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/gists/a5d885816f7dc042a78df11ce6cf9652/main.py/ipython3/).

You can also run the game offline using a terminal. Start by downloading this repository using [this link](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/archive/master.zip) and unzipping it.

Once you've downloaded the repository, navigate with the terminal to

``` Quantum_Programming_Tutorial-master/Hello-Quantum```

Then use the following command to run the tutorial (note: you'll need Python 3)

```
python main.py
```

The program runs on the terminal. For best results, you should maximize the size of your terminal window. If you need to change font and background settings, you can use the `âŒ˜,` shortcut on Mac. The *Basic* profile with Menlo 11pt font and white background work well.

## What next?

For some discussion of what is being done in the tutorial, check out the following articles.

* [A quantum superposition of a tiger and a bear](https://medium.com/qiskitters/a-quantum-superposition-of-a-tiger-and-a-bear-b461e3b23908)

More are coming soon.

Once you have mastered this gamified tutorial, you will be writing the kind of quantum programs found in the [tutorial for the QISKit SDK](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial). So head there to find more inspiration.
