# Hello Quantum

Do you want to program quantum computers, but don't know where to start? Then you have found the right place! Here you will find a gamified tutorial to quantum programming, which will guide you in the creation of your first quantum programs.

This tutorial is currently in beta, and so content will be added over time. **We are seeking any and all feedback throughout this process to help us build the finished product.**

You can start off with **Story Mode**, which will introduce you to the basics of manipulating quantum information. Each level is presented as a simple puzzle, and there is *almost* a storyline, so it might even seem like you are playing a game!

Then there are a range of modes designed to interact with Jupyter notebooks that we've created. The tutorial will guide you to create your own program to solve a real problem, and the notebooks will allow you to run these programs on a real quantum computer.

Current supported modes are as follows.

* **Image Superposer**: Create quantum superpositions of images with the notebook [here](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/tree/master/image-superposer).

More are coming soon.

There is also the **Sandbox Mode**, which let's you try out all the skills learned in the puzzles.

## How to use

**Browser version**

The easiest way is to use the browswer version [here](https://repl.it/@quantum_jim/QuantumProgrammingTutorial). Just press the run button, as highlighted in red in the image below.

Depending on your screen size, you may also need to pull the divider between source and console to the left and/or zoom out.

**Desktop Version**

The game can also be run offline on your own console. To do this, start by downloading this repository using [this link](https://github.com/decodoku/Quantum_Programming_Tutorial/archive/master.zip) and unzipping it.

Once you've downloaded the repository, navigate with the terminal to

``` Quantum_Programming_Tutorial-master/Hello_Quantum_Python```

Then use the following command to run the tutorial

```
python main.py
```

The program runs on the terminal. For best results, you should maximize the size of your command line window. If you need to change font and background settings, you can use the `âŒ˜,` shortcut on Mac. The *Basic* profile with Menlo 11pt font and white background work well.

## What next?

For some discussion of what is being done in the tutorial, check out the following articles.
* [Visualizing bits and qubits](https://medium.com/qiskitters/visualizing-bits-and-qubits-9af287047b28)

More are coming soon.

Once you have mastered this gamified tutorial, you will be writing the kind of quantum programs found in the [tutorial for the QISKit SDK](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial). So head there to find more inspiration.
